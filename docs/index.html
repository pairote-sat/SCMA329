<div id="introduction-to-financial-modelling" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction to Financial Modelling</h2>
<p>A financial model is a financial representation of a real world
financial situation, which is either a mathematical or statistical model
that describes the relationship among the variables of the financial
problem. Here are some types of financial models.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Financial statement model:</strong> The model includes three main
components including income statement, cash flow statement and
balance sheet. These are accounting reports issued by a company
quarterly and annually that are used for decision making and
performing financial analysis. (see
<a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/three-financial-statements/" class="uri">https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/three-financial-statements/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project finance models:</strong> The model incorporates two main elements
of the project including loans and debt repayment. It can be used to
assess the risk-reward of lending to or investing in a long-term
project, i.e. it can be used to tell whether the project has enough
cash to cover the debt in the long term. (see
<a href="https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/project-finance-model-structure/" class="uri">https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/project-finance-model-structure/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discounted cashflow model:</strong> It is the model to value a company
using the net present value of the business’s future cashflows, or
to estimate the value of an investment based on its future cash
flows. (see
<a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/templates/excel-modeling/dcf-model-template/" class="uri">https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/templates/excel-modeling/dcf-model-template/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pricing models:</strong> This models the way prices are set within a
market in order to maximise profits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter covers the basic concepts of calculating interest,
including simple and compound interest, the frequency of compounding,
the effective interest rate and the discount rate, and the present and
future values of a single payment.</p>
</div>
<div id="cashflows" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Cashflows</h2>
<p>Cashflows are amounts of money which are received (or income, positive
cashflows) or paid (or outgo, negative cashflows) at particular times.
Those payments arise from a financial transaction, e.g</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a bank account,</p></li>
<li><p>a loan,</p></li>
<li><p>an equity,</p></li>
<li><p>a zero-coupon bond: A bond is a fixed income instrument that
represents a loan from an investor to a debtor either a government
or a corporation. A zero-coupon bond is a bond that pays no interest
during its life.</p></li>
<li><p>a fixed interest security: A fixed-income security is a debt
instrument such as a bond or debenture that investors use to lend
money to a company in exchange for interest payments.</p></li>
<li><p>an index-linked security: An index-linked bonds pay interest that is
tied to an underlying index, such as the consumer price index (CPI).
Index-linked bonds are issued by governments to mitigate the effects
of inflation by paying a real return plus accrued inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>an annuity: An annuity is a series of payments made at regular
intervals, such as equal monthly payments on a mortgage.</p></li>
<li><p>a capital project etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cash received represents inflows, income or also called <strong>positive
cashflows</strong>, while money spent represents outflows, outgo or <strong>negative
cashflows</strong>. The net cashflow at a given point in time is the difference
between expenses and income.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-1" class="example"><strong>Example 1.1  </strong></span><em>A series of payments into and out of a bank account is given as
follows:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>payments into the account : ฿1000 on 1 January 2014 and ฿100 on 1
January 2016</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>payments out of the account : ฿200 on 1 July 2015, ฿300 on 1 July
2016, and ฿400 on 1 January 2018</em></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In practice, cashflows can be represented by a timeline as can be
illustrated in this example.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:tikz-ex1"></span>

<div id="interest-and-the-time-value-of-money" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Interest and the Time Value of Money</h2>
<p>This section introduces the time value of money using the concepts of
compound interest and discounting. The effect of interest rates on the
present value of future cash flows is discussed. The value of distant
cash flows in the present and current cash flows in the future are then
considered.</p>
<p>We illustrate the time value of money by considering the following
examples.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:egpv" class="example"><strong>Example 1.2  </strong></span><em>An investor want to make a payment of ฿10000 in 2 years. Suppose that a
bank pays compound interest at 4% per annum effective. How much should
the initial investment?</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The amount we need to invest now (i.e. the initial investment
in this example) is called the <em>present value (PV)</em> or <em>discounted
value</em> of the payments.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The interest for year 1 is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ X \cdot 0.04.\]</span> For year 2 the principal is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ X + X \cdot 0.04 = X \cdot (1 + 0.04)\]</span> so that the interest for the
year is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ X \cdot (1 + 0.04) \cdot 0.04.\]</span></p>
<p>By the end of 2 years an initial payment of ฿X will have accumulated to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X\cdot (1 + 0.04) + X \cdot (1 + 0.04) \cdot 0.04 =   X  \cdot  1.04^2 = 10000.\]</span>
Hence,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X = \frac{10000}{1.04^2} = 9245.56213,\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We refer to the amount to which the capital accumulates with
the addition of interest as <em>accumulation</em> or <em>accumulated value</em>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-2" class="example"><strong>Example 1.3  </strong></span><em>Consider the following arguments</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>It is obvious that you would prefer to have ฿1100 now than ฿1000
now.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>If we receive and hold ฿1 now, then it is worth more than receiving
and holding ฿1 at some time in the future? Why is this?</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Is it obvious that your would be better off with ฿1100 in 2 years
than ฿1000 now?</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the second argument, this one baht will grow to <span class="math inline">\(1 + r\)</span> in the first
year, <span class="math inline">\((1 + r)^2\)</span> in two years, and so on. These amounts are clearly
worth more than receiving and holding ฿1 at the same time in the future.</p>
<p>For the last argument, we need to compare the values of the amounts
**received at different times. To do this, we can look at the today’s
values of ฿1100 received in 2 years assuming that we can invest at an
annual interest rate of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> percent.</p>
<p>The present value of this amount <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in year 2 is <span class="math display">\[ 1100/(1 + r)^2.\]</span> Assuming <span class="math inline">\(r = 5\%\)</span>, the present value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is 997.7324263.</p>
<p>Comparing the values in today’s baths, it is better to
have ฿1000 now than to have ฿1100 in 2 years.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Simple interest</h3>
<p>Simple interest is a calculation of interest that does not take into

<p>Suppose an amount <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is deposited in
an account that pays simple interest at the rate of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>% per annum. Then
after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> years the deposit will have accumulated to

<p>For year 2, the principal is <span class="math inline">\(1 + i\)</span> and the interest for the year is

<p>The effect of compounding is to increase the total amount of accumulation. The effect is greater when the interest rate is high. This example shows two examples of the accumulated amount of ฿100 under the simple interest approach and the compound interest approach. As can be seen, the compound interest method makes the principle increase much faster than the simple interest method when the interest rate is high.</p>

<div id="frequency-of-compounding" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Frequency of Compounding</h2>
<p>Even though the interest rate is typically expressed in annual terms, an investment’s interest is frequently paid more frequently than once per year. For example, a savings account may offer an interest rate of 4% per year, credited quarterly. This interest rate is usually referred to as <strong>nominal rate of interest</strong>, i.e., 4% due four times per year.</p>
<p>We will see that the frequency of interest payments, also known as the frequency of compounding, has a significant impact on the total amount accrued and the interest collected. Consequently, it is crucial to precisely specify the rate of interest.</p>
<p>We use <span class="math inline">\(i^{(m)}\)</span> to represent the nominal rate of interest payable <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times a year in order to underline the significance of the frequency of compounding. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the
frequency of compounding per year and <span class="math inline">\(1/m\)</span> year is the <strong>compounding period</strong> or <strong>conversion period</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The nominal rate of interest payable <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times per period is also known as the rate of interest convertible <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>thly or compounded <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>thly.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-5" class="example"><strong>Example 1.5  </strong></span>Calculate the accumulated value in 1 year of a deposit of ฿100 in a saving account that earns interest at 10% payable quarterly.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> In this example, the nominal rate of interest of <span class="math inline">\(i^{(4)} = 10\%\)</span> p.a. convertible
quarterly means an interest rate of 10%/4 = 2.5% per quarter. In this case, the interest rate of 2.5% is called <em>effective interest</em>. The effective interest rate of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> per unit of time (which may be month, quarter, etc.) is the amount of interest received at the end of a unit of time per ฿1 invested at the beginning of that unit.</p>
<p>Therefore, the nominal interest rate <span class="math inline">\(i^{(4)} = 10\%\)</span> is equivalent to an
<em>effective interest rate</em> of <span class="math inline">\(2.5\%\)</span> per quarter.
The accumulated value in
1 year is <span class="math inline">\(100 (1 + \frac{10\%}{4})^4 = 100 (1 + 2.5\%)^4 = 110.3813\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that after compound interest is
taken into account, the interest income of an investor at the quarterly

</div>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The nominal interest rate <span class="math inline">\(i^{(4)} = 12\%\)</span> is equivalent
to an effective interest rate of <span class="math inline">\(3\%\)</span> per quarter. The accumulated
value in 1 year is <span class="math inline">\(100 (1 + 3\%)^4 = 112.55\)</span>. After compound interest
is taken into account, the interest income of an investor at the

<p>The compounding frequency affects the accumulated amount. As a result, it may be inaccurate to compare two investment strategies only based on their nominal rates of return without also taking into account their frequency of compounding. It is necessary to compare different investment strategies on an equal basis. The measure known as the <strong>effective interest rate</strong> is often used for this purpose.</p>
<p>The effective rate of interest of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> per time unit is the amount of

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The value of investment after one year at this rate is

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Level Annuities Due</h3>
<p>An <em>annuity-due</em> is an annuity where the payments made at the start of
each time period (instead of a the end), i.e. the payments are paid <em>in
advance</em>.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the present value or accumulation of an annuity
due, we first introduce the concept of the rate of discount.</p>
<div id="the-rate-of-discount" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The rate of discount</h4>
<p>As opposed to the interest rate where the accumulation of initial
investment can be obtained by multiplying it by the accumulation factor
<span class="math inline">\((1+i)^n\)</span>, we can obtain the discounted value of payment by using
discount rates.</p>
<p>Suppose an amount of ฿1 is due after 1 year with an effective rate of
<span class="math inline">\(i \%\)</span> p.a. (see the timeline below). What is the amount of money
required to invested now to accumulate to 1?</p>
<p>The amount of money required now to accumulate to ฿1 in one year is
<span class="math display">\[v =  \frac{1}{1+i}.\]</span> Note that <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{1+i} = 1 - \frac{i}{1+i}.\]</span>
We define the effective rate of discount <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> per annum
as<span class="math display">\[d = \frac{i}{1+i}.\]</span> It follows that
<span class="math display">\[v = \frac{1}{1+i} = 1 - \frac{i}{1+i} =  1 - d\]</span> represents the
discount of ฿1 for 1 year using the effective rate of interest of <span class="math inline">\(i \%\)</span>
p.a.</p>
<p>Similarly, suppose an amount of ฿1 is due after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> year with an
effective rate of <span class="math inline">\(i \%\)</span> p.a. The amount of money required to invested
now to accumulate to 1 in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> year is <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{(1+i)^n} = (1-d)^n.\]</span>
See the timeline below for illustration.</p>
<div class="example">

</div>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> After 1 year the discount will be <span class="math inline">\(0.05 \cdot 2000 = 100,\)</span>
and the discounted value of the payment will be
<span class="math display">\[2000 \cdot (1 - d) = 2000 \cdot (1 - 0.05) = 1900 .\]</span> Similarly, after
2 years, the discounted value will be
<span class="math display">\[2000 \cdot (1 - d)^2 = 2000 \cdot (1 - 0.05)^2 = 1805 .\]</span> After 3
years, the discounted value of the payment will be
<span class="math display">\[2000 \cdot (1 - d)^3 = 2000 \cdot (1 - 0.05)^3 = 1714.75 .\]</span></p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-29" class="example"><strong>Example 1.26  </strong></span><em>The effective rate of discount</em> <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> per time unit can be regarded as
the interest paid in advance at time 0, which is equivalent to the
effective rate of interest <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> payable in arrears.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> To show this, suppose that the bank added interest of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
to an account of an amount of 1 unit at the start of the period. Assume
that the interest amount of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can be withdrawn and invested in another
bank that earn the rate of interest <span class="math inline">\(i\%\)</span> effective per time unit. The
principle of 1 unit is still in the first bank.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, we have</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the principle of 1 unit in the first bank, and</p></li>
<li><p>the interest paid in advance which accumulates to <span class="math inline">\(x(1+i)\)</span> in the
second bank.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For this to be equivalent to the interest paid in arrears, we can find
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> which solves <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
     1 + x(1+i) &amp;= 1 + i,\\
     x &amp;= \frac{i}{1+i} = \frac{1+i}{1+i} - \frac{1}{1+i}  = 1-v = d.\end{aligned}\]</span>
Therefore, the effective rate of discount <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> per time unit can be
regarded as the interest paid in advance at time 0, which is equivalent
to the effective rate of interest <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> payable in arrears.</p>

<p>Nominal interest rates are the interest rates before taking inflation

or stated rates of interest on a loan, without regard to fees or
compound interest. Throughout this section, the time unit used is
assumed to be <strong>one year</strong>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> Equation of value and yields</h3>
<p>Consider a transaction from an investment that offers</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to pay an investor of amounts (i.e. money received)
<span class="math inline">\(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_1, t_2, \ldots ,t_n\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>in return for outlays (i.e. money paid out) of amounts
<span class="math inline">\(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\)</span> at these times, respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Only one of <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_i\)</span> will be non-zero in general.</p>
<p><strong>An equation of value</strong> equates the present value of money received to
the present value of money paid out, which can be written as
<span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^n A_i v^i = \sum_{i=1}^n B_i v^i.\]</span> The equation of value
can also be written in terms of the <strong>net cashflow</strong> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>, i.e.
<span class="math inline">\(C_t = B_t - A_t\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[PV_i(0) = \sum_{i=1}^n C_i v^i =0.\]</span></p>
<p>Equations of value are used throughout actuarial work. Some examples are
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>fair price</strong> to pay for an investment such as a fixed interest
security or an equity (ie, <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span> outgo) equals the present value of
the proceeds from the investment, discounted at the rate of interest
required by the investor.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>premium</strong> for an insurance policy is calculated by equating
the present value of the expected amounts received in premiums to
the present value of the expected benefits and other outgo.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We shall be concerned mainly with the question:</p>
<p>At what rate of interest does the series of amounts paid out have the
same value as the series of amounts received? The corresponding rate of
interest is called the <strong>yield of the cashflows</strong> (or <strong>internal rate of
return, money-weighted rate of return</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<div id="the-method-to-estimate-the-yield" class="section level3" number="1.7.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> The method to estimate the yield</h3>
<p>By using linear interpolation, the yield can be estimated as follows.
Let <span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_2\)</span> be the present values calculated at interest rates
<span class="math inline">\(i_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i_2\)</span>, respectively. Then the interest rate corresponding to a
present value of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> can be approximated by
<span class="math display">\[i \approx i_1 + (i_2 - i_1) \frac{P - P_1}{P_2 - P_1}.\]</span> In order to
apply this method to calculate the yield <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we simply set <span class="math inline">\(P = 0\)</span>, and
hence <span class="math display">\[i \approx i_1 + (i_2 - i_1) \frac{ - P_1}{P_2 - P_1}.\]</span></p>
<p>From the figure above, the yield <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can be approximated by <span class="math inline">\(i^*\)</span>, which
is the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-intercept of the straight line joining the points <span class="math inline">\((i_1,P_1)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\((i_2,P_2)\)</span>. From
<span class="math display">\[\frac{i^* -i_1}{i_2 - i_1} = \frac{P_{i^*} - P_1}{P_2 - P_1},\]</span> we
have <span class="math inline">\(P_{i^*} = 0\)</span> and
<span class="math display">\[i \approx i^* =  i_1 + (i_2 - i_1) \frac{ - P_1}{P_2 - P_1}.\]</span> Note
that one can get a good approximation by taking values that are either
side of the true value and about 1% apart.</p>
